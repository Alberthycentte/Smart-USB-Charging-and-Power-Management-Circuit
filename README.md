This custom-designed circuit board manages power distribution between a USB source, a rechargeable battery, and an external load. When connected to a USB power source, the circuit intelligently routes power to the load while charging the battery in parallel. Once the USB is disconnected, it seamlessly switches to battery power, ensuring uninterrupted operation of the connected device.

The design includes an onboard LED indicator that displays the charging status, making it easy to monitor battery activity at a glance. The compact layout and use of surface-mount components allow for efficient space utilization while maintaining clear signal routing and reliable performance.
